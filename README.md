## How should this work

1. The player put the cards into the robot
2. The player/s needs to press the keypad to start the game (selecting how many players)
3. the roboto should deal each player two cards and one to itself
4. Then each player should be ask if they want to hit or stand
5. If the player hits, the roboto should deal them a card and repeat until they stand
6. Then the robot should pass to the next player

Technical:

7. The robot will read the first card, ask to arduino to deal the card
8. The robot will read the second card, ask to arduino turn to the dealer plate and deal the card
